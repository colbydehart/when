# Final Capstone

This is the final capstone for this portion of the class.

This capstone is intended to demonstrate your mastery of basic git, project documentation (README, comments), writing unit tests, javascript, jQuery, basic-to-intermediate Angular, and basic API integrations.

Project Criteria:

* Pick a project you're excited about!
* Pick a project that demonstrates the major skills you've learned so far (see above)
* Must display thoughtful effort in the styling/user interface
* This is one of the two major resume pieces that you will be showing to employers, so take that into consideration.\*

The sky is the limit for project ideas.  However, I will be helping you limit the initial scope of your projects.


\* E.g. Don't choose a work-inappropriate project

## Milestone 1: Pick a Project (Tuesday)

Project Idea Inspiration:

- Web versions of desktop utilities, or
- Duplicate a web app that you like, or
- Extend the functionality of a web application you use frequently, via. it's API, or
- Draw from the list of past project ideas, in nss/project-ideas.md

In class, we will go over your project ideas and make sure that they are suitable for the project's goals.

## Milestone 2: Create wireframes and user stories (on Tuesday)

Write a set of user stories describing your features, based on the user stories article.

Commit your list of user stories to your project in the doc directory (e.g. doc/user_stories.md) of your project.

## Milestone 3: Implement and Deploy your first feature (by Friday)

This is to ensure that your project is set up and ready to roll while we can still help you before the break.

## Milestone 4: Project Presentations

These will be sometime in the week after the break.
